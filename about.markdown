I'm a reformed chemist who's currently working as a Staff Machine Learning Scientist @ Beyond.
I enjoy thinking deeply about complex problems, tackling them with the simplest possible solutions.
I've worked at research institutions, banking, a drug discovery startup and an e-commerce site.

I've got two kids and I live in a small seaside town on the west coast of Ireland.
