Simulations are an underappreciated and underused tool in many companies. 
Most companies have multiple complex systems, many times interacting with each other, which require constant optimisation and simply need constant monitoring to understand.
We are generally afraid to touch these systems as we're unsure of the impact of the changes on it or on downstream systems.
If we can build simulations that can correspond well enough to these systems to answer important questions about the systems, then we can more freely experiment in that sandbox environment and understand our systems more completely.
Successes at large companies are out there ([Amazon](https://d1.awsstatic.com/events/Summits/reinvent2022/INO105_Supply-chain-and-logistics.pdf) and [Doordash](https://doordash.engineering/2022/08/16/4-essential-steps-for-building-a-simulator/) are two examples).
I want to argue that teams that are implementing Machine Learning products are the same teams that have complex enough systems to warrant simulating, but are also the same teams with the skill sets to build and use simulations.
In this post I want to go through the different components of a simulation, how to ensure your simulation can answer your questions without overengineering, and also ...

## What is a simulation
> A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time

_[INTRODUCTION TO SIMULATION, Jerry Banks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/324138.324142)_

I think of a simulations as trying to reproduce reality in a simpler, modifiable setting. 
A very tangible example of a simulation is the [Mississippi River Basin model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River_Basin_Model). 
This was built in the 1940s to aid systematic understanding of flood control measures that had been built on the Mississippi river in the previous decade.
These locks, run-off channels and levees could prevent local flooding but may increase flooding in other areas so it was clear that a big picture understanding of how to implement these measures was needed.
Various segments of the Mississippi River became operational in the simulation throughout the 1950s, helping to avoid damage of an estimated $65 million in 1952 along (almost a billion dollars in today's money)
Tests on individual problems were conducted until 1971 but high costs and growth of computer modelling meant that the facility was put on standby.

We can use this example to explore the different parts that make up a simulation.
### What makes up a simulation
 ![img.png](/assets/images/simulations/components.png)
- Input
  - Amount of water added at upstream points
- Mechanism
  - Literal recreation of the landscape at reduced scales
  - Real physics (gravity, hydrodynamics etc)
- Output
  - Water heights at downstream points at various times

Depending on which part of the simulation is generating new data, the simulation is used for different purposes
For example using earth's atmosphere as a domain:
- Whatâ€™s the weather tomorrow? -> Prediction
- What would the climate be like next century IF we reduce emissions -> Prediction
- How do hurricanes form? -> Explanation
- What was the climate like 1million years ago -> Retrodiction

### Correspondence
Why some simulations were bad 

### Calibration
Necessary for later in presentation, not necessary here?

### Running a simulation

### Why use simulations
- Make predictions about the future
- Too risky/expensive to do in reality
- Floods of areas
- Too slow to do in reality
- Simulate the cosmic web
- Need to run too many experiments
- Waymo has driven 1000x more in simulations than in reality
- Reinforcement learning requires more data than reality can provide
- Impossible to make measurements of real system
- Protein simulations allow visualization of the movement of proteins 

### Conclusion
You should simulate too. If you want to, look into reinforcement learning papers to find how they've simulated since it's so data hungry
