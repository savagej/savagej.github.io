## Conclusion
A generative culture
- Big Data infrastructure has always been rock solid here
- Addition of ML workloads created new valuable datasets
- Creation of infrastructure allowed new ML workloads
- Ultimately the value from all this is generated from the use cases
- Success in areas drove improvements in other areas
- Even failures lead to learnings that have improved later use cases

▪ Generative AI allows getting to proof of concept much quicker
▪ Data data data
– “Private data is a durable moat”
▪ Engineering problem more than a science problem
▪ We’re lucky that Overstock has a deep data and ML infrastructure
▪ What are the use cases?
– The more use cases we work on, the more we understand the powers and limitation of these
